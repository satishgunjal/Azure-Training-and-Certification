# Prerequisites <a id ="1"></a>
This certification is intended for candidates beginning to work with data in the cloud. Candidate should have foundational knowledge of core data concepts and how they are implemented using Microsoft Azure data services. Candidates should be familiar with the concepts of relational and non-relational data, and different types of data workloads such as transactional or analytical.


# Why to do it? <a id ="2"></a>
This certificate provides you an opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge of core data concepts and how they are implemented using Microsoft Azure data services. Azure Data Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based certifications like Azure Database Administrator Associate or Azure Data Engineer Associate. It will add value to your skill set and expertise if you into job roles like Azure Data Analyst, Azure Database Administrator, Azure Data Engineer, Solutions Architect etc.


# Exam, Languages & Price <a id ="3"></a>
To get this certificate you need to pass 'Exam DP-900', which is available in English, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean, French, German, Spanish. Price is based on the country in which the exam is proctored. In the USA it's for $99 USD and in India it's for â‚¹3696 INR.

In exam, you will get 60 minutes to answer around 49 multiple choice questions. To pass the exam, you will need to score 700 points out of 1000. I got 903 points, [Link to my certification badge](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/be4be8de-18a5-41d4-afda-747299639f14/public_url)

# Learning Path <a id ="5"></a>

There are two ways to prepare for this exam. You can either self-teach using free online resources or can go for instructor led path. In this article I will list all the required resources from Microsoft Learn to clear this exam.
Remember objective should be to achieve the necessary knowledge instead of just clearing certifications. If you google it, you will find tons of material with question and answers for this exam. But that won't help you to gain necessary knowledge.  In machine learning terminology, use all the learning material as 'training data' and use online question dumps as your 'test data'. Remember if you use 'test data' during training then it may result in good score but will definitely fail in real life scenarios!

Below are the learning resources for each of the section mentioned in skill measured table. At the end of each learning resource there is knowledge check section, to test your understanding of a particular module.

# Practice Exams <a id ="13"></a>
Its always a better idea to do few practice tests, before going for final exam. I have taken [Examtopics](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/dp-900/) practice test. I have also prepared my handwritten notes based on above learning path that I have refered before the final exam. I have also refered the [200 Practice Questions For Azure Data DP-900 Fundamentals Exam](https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/200-practice-questions-for-azure-data-dp-900-fundamentals-exam-ea2446ee3a0).
