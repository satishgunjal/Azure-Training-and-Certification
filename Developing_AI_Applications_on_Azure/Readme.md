# Week 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
This module introduces Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Next, we talk about machine learning types and tasks. This leads into a discussion of machine learning algorithms. Finally we explore python as a popular language for machine learning solutions and share some scientific ecosystem packages which will help you implement machine learning. By the end of this unit you will be able to implement machine learning models in at least one of the available python machine learning libraries.

## Learning Objectives
* Define Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Explain common machine learning tasks and algorithms
* Describe languages used in Data Science​
* Use basic Python commands
* Describe the Python Scientific Ecosystem and Development Environments​
* Explore open source Resources for solving machine learning problems​

# Week 2: Standardized AI Processes and Azure Resources
This module introduces machine learning tools available in Microsoft Azure. It then looks at standardized approaches developed to help data analytics projects to be successful. Finally, it gives you specific guidance on Microsoft's Team Data Science Approach to include roles and tasks involved with the process. The exercise at the end of this unit points you to Microsoft's documentation to implement this process in their DevOps solution if you don't have your own.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe Artificial Intelligence Tools available in Azure
* Explain the need for a standardized approach to data science projects
* Compare and contrast popular data science project management approaches
* List the steps of the Microsoft Team Data Science Process
* Define the roles of different members of the Team Data Science Process

# Week 3: Standardized AI Processes and Azure Resources
This module introduces you to Microsoft's pretrained and managed machine learning offered as REST API's in their suite of cognitive services. We specifically implement solutions using the computer vision api, the facial recognition api, and do sentiment analysis by calling the natural language service.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe the capabilities of Azure's Computer Vision Cognitive API
* Summarize the components of Azure's Language Cognitive Service
* Understand how to access Azure's Search Cognitive API
* Understand and use Azure's Speech Cognitive Service
* Employ Azure's Decision Cognitive API

# Week 4: Azure Machine Learning Service: Model Training
This module introduces you to the capabilities of the Azure Machine Learning Service. We explore how to create and then reference an ML workspace. We then talk about how to train a machine learning model using the Azure ML service. We talk about the purpose and role of experiments, runs, and models. Finally, we talk about Azure resources available to train your machine learning models with. Exercises in this unit include creating a workspace, building a compute target, and executing a training run using the Azure ML service.

## Learning Objectives
* Discuss the Azure Machine Learning Service
* Create and Use an Azure Machine Learning Workspace
* Train your own model using Azure Machine Learning Service
* Define available compute resources for model training in Azure
* Recall how to setup up an experiment, execute a run, and access a model in Azure Machine Learning Service

# Week 5: Azure Machine Learning Service: Model Management and Deployment
This module covers how to connect to your workspace. Next, we discuss how the model registry works and how to register a trained model locally and from a workspace training run. In addition, we show you the steps to prepare a model for deployment including identifying dependencies, configuring a deployment target, building a container image. Finally, we deploy a trained model as a webservice and test it by sending JSON objects to the API.

## Learning Objectives
* Demonstrate how to connect to an existing workspace programmatically
* Explain how to reference a model trained in the cloud
* Describe the steps required to deploy a model in the cloud
* Implement a scoring script
* Understand how to deploy and test a model registered in Azure
