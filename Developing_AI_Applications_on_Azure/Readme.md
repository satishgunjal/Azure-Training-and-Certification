# Week 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
This module introduces Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Next, we talk about machine learning types and tasks. This leads into a discussion of machine learning algorithms. Finally we explore python as a popular language for machine learning solutions and share some scientific ecosystem packages which will help you implement machine learning. By the end of this unit you will be able to implement machine learning models in at least one of the available python machine learning libraries.

# Week 2: Standardized AI Processes and Azure Resources
This module introduces machine learning tools available in Microsoft Azure. It then looks at standardized approaches developed to help data analytics projects to be successful. Finally, it gives you specific guidance on Microsoft's Team Data Science Approach to include roles and tasks involved with the process. The exercise at the end of this unit points you to Microsoft's documentation to implement this process in their DevOps solution if you don't have your own.
